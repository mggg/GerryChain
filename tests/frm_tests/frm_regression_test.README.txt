I created a regression test based on the User Guide code so that
I could make changes and quickly test whether they affected
user code.

The 3 files that I added are:

    * frm_regression_test.py
        * Code copied from the User Guide
    * gerrymandria.json
        * JSON for the graph used in the regression test
    * frm_regression_test.README.txt
        * This file
