    #       records for each (i,j) whether there is an edge between the
    #       two nodes i and j.

    #       code, we could just copy it - my guess is that it does not
    #       depend on specifics of the NetworkX implementation much...

    #       Another option in the short term is to convert the rxgraph
    #       back into a nxgraph for the purposes of doing the laplacian
    #       and then converting it back.  I am not sure that we would 
    #       need to convert it back - does anyone else ever care about
    #       the weights that were assigned?  In any event, this would
    #       allow us to proceed (for now) without having to reimplement
    #       the laplacian functions to work on an rxgraph.
    #
    #       Note that since my frm_regresion.py test relies on recom
    #       not spectral_recom, I could just punt on this altogether for
    #       now, and just have this raise an exception saying "Not Yet Implemented"

    #           that converts a sparse matrix into its dense representation as a NumPy matrix.
    #           So, this is just a way to get a NumPy matrix for the laplacian (or normalized_laplacian).
    #
    #
    #           Note that while the standard laplacian is straight forward mathematically
    #           the normalized laplacian is a good bit more complicated.  However, since 
    #           NetworkX is open source - perhaps we can get permission to just use their
