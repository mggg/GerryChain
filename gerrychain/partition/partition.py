#
#               Since a Partition is intimately tied up with how the Markov Chain
#               does its magic, it would make sense to talk about that a bit...

#               For instance, is there any reason to use a Partition object 
#               except in a Markov Chain?  I suppose they are useful for post
#               Markov Chain analysis - but if so, then it would be nice to 
#               know what functionality is tuned for the Markov Chain and what
#               functionality / data is tuned for post Markov Chain analysis.
