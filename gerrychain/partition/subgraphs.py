#                   YES - it is used as the type of Partition.subgraphs.  So, I need to find
#                   all access to partition.subgraphs and see how it is used.  It is also
#                   used in contiguity.py
#
#                   This may be an opportunity to encapsulate knowldege of node_indices vs.
#                   node_names...
