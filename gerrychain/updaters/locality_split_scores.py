class LocalitySplits:
    """
    Computes various splitting measures for a partition

    Can be used to compute how a districting plan splits
    against any static attribute. The prototypical example
    is to consider how a districting plan subdivides counties
    or municipalities, but other units, such as city
    neighborhoods, state legislative districts, or Census
    tracts could be treated as 'localities'

    Example usage::

        # Assuming your nodes have attributes "countyID"
        # with (for example) the name of the county that
        # node lies in and a population attribute "pop":
        county_splits = LocalitySplits(
            "countysplits",
            "countyID",
            "pop",
            ["num_parts", "symmetric_entropy","power_entropy"],
            pent_alpha = 0.8
        )
        # Assuming you already have a graph and assignment:
        partition = Partition(
            graph,
            assignment,
            updaters={"county_splits" : county_splits}
        )

        # at each step of the chain has the name of the score
        # and its value at that step
