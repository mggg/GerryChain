    Use this decorator to create an updater that responds to flows of nodes
    between parts of the partition.

    Decorate a function that takes:
    - The partition
    - The previous value of the updater on a fixed part P_i
    - The new nodes that are just joining P_i at this step
    - The old nodes that are just leaving P_i at this step
